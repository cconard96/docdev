High-Level API
==============

The High-Level API (HL API) is a new API system provided in GLPI starting with version 10.1.0.
While the user experience is more simplified than the legacy API (the REST API available in previous versions), the implementation is quite a bit more complex.
The following sections explain the various components of the new API.
These sections are sorted by the recommended reading order. It is recommended that you read the High-Level API user documentation first if you have no experience with the API at all.
